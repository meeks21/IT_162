            <p>Galleries and Sliders come in all shapes and sizes and there are numerous ways to create these fundamental UI components. They are both great ways for a developer to display multiple images on a webpage, but before moving any further lets first address the differences between an image gallery versus an image slider. “An image gallery is a group of images, displayed together in a grid. You generally see all of the images at once”(Hills). Whereas “image sliders are usually large on the site, and either automatically change, or you click on the slider controls and the image moves. Sometimes there are little dots under the images to show you where in the series you are. Some sliders move fast, and some are slower, and some have different kinds of transitions, for example swipe or cross dissolved”(Hills).</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are also a multitude of features that a developer or designer may want included in an image slider. “Just as one example, you might want the slider to be swiped or scrolled. Or, you might not want that, and to have the slider only respond to click or tappable buttons that navigate to slides. Or you might want both. Or you might want to combine all that with autoplay”(Coyier). Sliders can be complicated, and for quite a few features JavaScript will need to be used, but there are ways to create a slider with just HTML and CSS (Coyier).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some examples of features that require JavaScript are the ability to flick with a mouse, or infinite scroll in a particular direction (Coyier). Both of which require manipulation of the document object model or DOM. However if you do not want to write out all those lines of code yourself then there is always the option to use any of the hundreds of jQuery responsive image sliders that are available online. Such sliders include; LayerSlider, FlexSlider, Wow Slider, Translucent, Saloon, and Blueberry just to name a few (Nice).

            <br>
	        <p>Now let's take a look at image galleries which are another way to present photos on a page. [W]e can create a CSS image gallery to play a professional look at a multi-image site; along with HTML, CSS is an excellent tool for creating a crafted website gallery; we can do this by using our core CSS properties; a simple gallery can be [created] using width and height, CSS borders, padding, float and text-align properties, [and] margins”(Ionescu).</p>
