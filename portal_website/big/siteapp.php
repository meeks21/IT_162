        <p>Responsive web sites and native mobile apps are two approaches used by individuals or institutions to supply web content to mobile devices. However there are several key differences between the two approaches. In the article “Responsive Website vs Mobile App: Comparison”
        Korol points out that one major distinction between the two is that responsive websites are used by companies to make their services, information, or goods available on various platforms. Responsive websites are available to everyone regardless of operating system and do not require the user to download or install anything(Korol). They also don't require the user to update anything, and no additional support is required either. Also responsive websites are "less expensive [and], [y]ou don’t have to create native [mobile] apps for each type of mobile phones and tablets when you have one responsive website. It also makes maintenance cost lower and working with SEO gets easier”(Korol).</p>
        <br>
        <p>On the other hand mobile apps are for businesses that want to provide a unique user experience to their clients, and while a responsive website is aimed at attracting new or occasional users mobile apps are aimed at regular clients (Korol). According to Korol a mobile app should not be a  clone of an organization's existing website, but rather a mobile app should highlight the key functions of your business. The mobile app's functions should be made simple to use for the customer. They also must be downloaded from some form of app store, they can function offline, they tend to have a more user friendly design, and they have access to mobile phone components (Korol). </p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite the differences between these two approaches that fact remains that “the use of mobile devices is growing extremely fast, so every business should be present on mobile devices in one way or another. Either mobile apps or responsive webs are great solutions”(Cherednichenko). However it is important to note that mobile devices account for at least 51% of the global internet traffic, and 90% of that traffic belongs to mobile apps (Cherednichenko). Yet most of that 90% of traffic belongs to banking apps, or popular as apps such as facebook and instagram (Cherednichenko). “Though traffic on mobile is huge, it doesn’t belong to apps only. The decision to create a mobile website or app depends on your domain, business processes, goals, and other factors like budget and deadline”(Cherednichenko).
