    <p>Shopping cart software is extremely vital for any business or individual who hopes to sell products online. There are a couple options when adding shopping cart software to your website. The first is to set up the software yourself, and the other is to use a ready made solution. “If you want to set your own shopping cart software up, you'll need ecommerce web hosting to be able to cater for your shopping website, and ensure you add a credit card processing option to take payments online”(Drake). Web hosting plans often include e-commerce functionality. Which include “templates for web stores, PayPal integration, easy installs for popular shopping carts”(Williams).

    <p>Credit card processing services are a vital part of online transactions, and any online business that wants to be successful needs to be able to take credit card transactions. “There are two main options with credit card processing services: one being a simple credit card processor with all fees paid per transactions, or alternatively a merchant account solution which comes with a monthly fee but offers far cheaper processing on a per item basis”(Turner). Some popular credit card processing services include PayPal, Sage, Stripe, Authorize.net, and Worldpay (Turner).

	<p>There are three types of shopping cart software cart software. They are open-source shopping cart software, licensed shopping cart software, and hosted eCommerce platforms. “An open source shopping cart has both benefits and drawbacks. Usually, the software is free, and with its source code available to developers everywhere, addons, bug fixes, and modified versions are often readily available.However, since an open source shopping cart is not controlled by any one person or company, you may struggle to find help with it”(A Powerful & Secure Shopping Cart for Your Website). “Licensed software is much more straightforward than open source. It's developed by a single company and available for your purchase and use. All development on the software is done by the company that created itl”(A Powerful & Secure Shopping Cart for Your Website). “A hosted eCommerce platform, also known as a SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution, combines both shopping cart software and web hosting. Instead of needing to find your own web server that meets the requirements of the software, the whole package is provided as a service”(A Powerful & Secure Shopping Cart for Your Website).</p>
